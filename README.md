### This might be a project.
Idk. Just something to show off and have on GH while I mess with nodejs/typescript.

### NIX!!!!!!!*
Using the power of nix you can try out the development environment I made for myself.
Clone this repo, `cd` into the repo, and run `nix develop`
**Note that flakes must be enabled.*

### Neovim stuff
`.nvimrc.lua` has neovim configuration. I source this in nvim by sourcing the file using an autocommand. See how I do it [ here ]( https://github.com/garaiza-93/nixos/blob/master/devtools/neovim/config/autocmd.lua#L60 )
